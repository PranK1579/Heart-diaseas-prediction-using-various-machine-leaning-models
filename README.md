# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications.

dataset contains attribbutes like age, sex, chest pain cholesterol level, blood sugar level, max heart rate etc.

Goal of the project is to predict wether the pateint will develope any heart diseases using different machine learning models listed below and to compare there accuuresies.


# Modelling and Model evaluation

DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER <br />
LOGISTIC REGRESSION <br />
RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER <br />
GRADIENT BOOSTING CLASSIFIER <br />



# relevant Libraries
pandas <br />
numpy <br />
matplotlib <br />
seaborn <br />

# Conclusion
I have found the hidden data insights using visualization and compare different machine learning models based on accuracy and it is found that Decision Tree and Random Forest work efficiently for this data set with accuracy 100%
